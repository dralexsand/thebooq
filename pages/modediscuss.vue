              The modest success of Crank at the box office and on home video had opened the possibility of a sequel for Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.[4] Even so, Neveldine and Taylor initially refused to direct one when approached by producer Skip Williamson of Lakeshore Entertainment, explaining that they had already "killed" Chev Chelios at the end of Crank, making the idea of a sequel preposterous. Instead, Neveldine and Taylor agreed to write the screenplay and stay on as producers.[5] After the script was completed, however, they agreed to direct as they believed no other director could possibly make what they had written. "We were going to write it, produce it and move on to something else. But by the time the script was finished, we had fallen in love with it and we were not going to let anyone else touch it," said Taylor.[6]
