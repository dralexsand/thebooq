          ex-hitman Chev Chelios, who, shortly after surviving a deadly fall on the streets of Los Angeles, is kidnapped
          and has his heart stolen by Chinese gangsters, replacing him with an artificial heart designed to keep him alive
          for an hour. Chev then sets out to find his heart while keeping himself electrically charged to stay alive. The
          film also features several cameo appearances of celebrities from various entertainment media.
    
          The film was released in the United Kingdom on April 15, 2009, two days prior to its North American release
          date; April 17, 2009. Upon its release, Crank: High Voltage received positive reviews with many praising the
          acting, action sequences, humor, story and writing.

          Chev Chelios lands in the middle of an intersection after falling out of a helicopter. He is scooped off the
          street by gangsters and removed from the scene. Chev wakes up in a makeshift hospital and sees doctors removing
          his heart while Johnny Vang watches. The doctors place an artificial heart in his chest. He wakes up later and
          escapes, noticing an external battery pack is attached to him. By interrogating a thug, he learns the location
          of Johnny Vang: the Cypress Social Club.
    
          Chev calls Doc Miles, who says that Chev has been fitted with an AbioCor artificial heart. Miles informs Chev
          that once the external battery pack runs out, the internal battery will kick in and he will have 60 minutes
          before it stops working. Chev crashes his car, destroying the external battery pack. After getting directions
          from a driver, Chev has the driver use jumper cables on him to charge the internal battery. At the club, Chev
          loses Vang but picks up a hooker named Ria, who sends him to a strip club where Vang is hiding out. In the club,
          Chev finds Eve, who is now working as a stripper. A group of Mexican mobsters, led by Chico, show up looking for
          Chev. After a gunfight, Chev learns that a mobster named "El Hur√≥n" ("The Ferret") wants to kill him, but he
          doesn't find out why.
    
          Chev commandeers a police cruiser with Eve and another stripper. The stripper tells Chev that he should look at
          the Hollywood Racetrack for Johnny Vang. Along the way, Chev meets Venus, the brother of Chev's deceased
          associate Kaylo. Wanting his help, Chev tells Venus that El Huron was involved in his brother's death. At the
          horse track Chev begins losing energy again. Another call to Doc Miles informs him that friction will cause
          static electricity to power the internal battery. Eve arrives and has sex with Chev on the racetrack, which
          generates enough friction to charge the heart. Chev spots Vang and leaves Eve behind. Vang escapes, and Chev is
          about to be subdued by security when Don Kim picks Chev up in a limo. He informs Chev that there is a prominent
          leader in the Triads named Poon Dong, who was in need of a heart transplant and chose Chev's to replace his.
          Chev kills Don Kim and his henchmen upon learning that Don Kim wishes to return him to Poon Dong for a reward.
          Meanwhile, Venus calls in Orlando to assist in tracking down El Huron.
    
          While searching for Vang, Chev boards an ambulance and steals a battery pack for his artificial heart. Chev
          exits the ambulance upon seeing Johnny Vang on the street outside and a shootout ensues before Chev subdues
          Vang. Chev learns that his heart has already been transplanted into Poon Dong. Johnny Vang is shot and killed by
          Chico as Chev questions him, and Chev is knocked unconscious. Doc Miles uses his secretary, Dark Chocolate, to
          lure Poon Dong into his apartment to kill him and retrieve Chev's heart.
    
          Chev is taken to an island where El Huron awaits. It is revealed that El Huron is the brother of Ricky and Alex
          Verona, both of whom Chelios killed. El Huron also reveals that Ricky Verona's disembodied head is being
          artificially kept alive long enough to watch El Huron kill Chelios. Orlando, Venus and Ria suddenly arrive with
          backup, and a shootout ensues, killing most of El Huron's men. Ricky Verona's head is killed during the melee.
          As he starts to slow down, Chev climbs a nearby electric pole and grabs a pair of live wires to recharge, being
          set on fire by the massive current. He returns fully powered and beats El Huron to death. Due to a hallucination
          caused by the electric currents, he sees Ria as Eve and kisses her, inadvertently setting her ablaze. Chev walks
          towards the camera and gives the audience the middle finger.
    
          During the end credits, Doc Miles replaces Chev's heart. Chelios's eyes open and his heart monitor indicates
          normal activity.
